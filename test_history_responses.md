# Context System - History Question Responses

## Current Context State:
- **Current Repository**: shashanks41/private-project
- **Available Branches**: feat/new, feature/test-branch, main
- **Recent Actions**: jira_get_projects, github_get_branches, jira_get_projects
- **Conversation History**: 5 previous interactions

## How Different History Questions Are Answered:

### 1. **"What did I do last?" / "What was my previous project?"**
**Context Used**: `recent_actions` (last tool called)
**Response**: "You last listed Jira projects." or "You last worked on shashanks41/private-project"

### 2. **"Show me my recent work" / "What have I been working on?"**
**Context Used**: `recent_actions` + `conversation_history`
**Response**: "You recently: 1) Listed Jira projects, 2) Checked branches for shashanks41/private-project, 3) Listed Jira projects again"

### 3. **"What repositories have I worked with?"**
**Context Used**: `current_repository` + `current_owner`
**Response**: "You're currently working with shashanks41/private-project"

### 4. **"What branches are available in my current project?"**
**Context Used**: `active_branches` + `current_repository`
**Response**: "In shashanks41/private-project, you have branches: feat/new, feature/test-branch, main"

### 5. **"What Jira projects have I accessed?"**
**Context Used**: `recent_jira_projects` + `current_jira_project_key`
**Response**: "You recently accessed Jira projects: [list of projects]"

### 6. **"Show me my conversation history"**
**Context Used**: `conversation_history` (last 3 conversations)
**Response**: "Recent conversations: 1) 'list jira projects' - tried to list projects, 2) 'show branches' - found 3 branches, etc."

## Context Enhancement Process:

1. **User asks history question** → No tool call needed
2. **Agent receives context** → `get_context_for_prompt()` provides summary
3. **Agent responds** → Uses context to answer without calling tools
4. **Context updated** → New conversation added to history

## Key Features:

✅ **Every command stored** - Both successful and failed attempts
✅ **Tool results preserved** - Branch lists, issue data, etc.
✅ **Cross-session persistence** - Context survives CLI restarts
✅ **Smart summarization** - Only relevant context provided to agent
✅ **Multi-platform tracking** - Both GitHub and Jira activities
